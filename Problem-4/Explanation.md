we have a function updateProfile with three prameters user key and newValue inside that function we use bracket notation  to access any key from user object and assign it to the new value basically what this function does is when we call it it takes the user objecjet which is userProfile in this case and takes a key as second prameter and that key is from the object i could be anyting and next newValue is the value we provide and when this funciton runs value gets updated, I guess this is pretty much what this code does but lets explain it further. we have a variable declared using const keyword and assign it to an object with keys and properties name age email and isActive a boolean after that we log the orignal profile which logs this object and then we call the updateProfile functon with different keys and values in first call we pass userProfile as first prameter and key is age and valuse is 31 and same second call third call is a bit different becuse it adds a new property instead of updating any of the existing properties it is possible becuse function updateds the object itself not the singular properties, finally we log it with a string and userProfile object this logs the updated object
