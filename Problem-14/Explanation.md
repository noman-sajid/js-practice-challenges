we have a function pass two parameter ages and minAge in the function we have a variable assigned every method on ages in the callback we pass age as paramenter and return if the age is greater than or equal to minAge and then we return allValid variablethen we have some variable assigne arays numbers and empty ages is assigned and empty array when we log the array and also log the call of function whilst array passed as an argument and 18 as second argument first is true cause condition is true on every element, second is false cause condition is not true on some elements, and te final one is true cause there is nothing to violate of stand against the condition, the key here is every method which goes through every element and checks if the condition in the callback is true or not on each the emphises here is on each element cause if one element voilates condition it returns false, we can say it is close cousin to some method with kind of opposite way to function
