we have a function countCharacterFrequencies and we pass text as a parameter in the function we create a variable frequencies and we assign it an empty object, we initialize it, then we have a variable which we use to lower case the test using toLowerCase function nest we have a for loop we initiate the loop pass the condition which is i less than lowerCasedText length and then we itterate it i, classic for loop in the loop we have a variable character we assign it the lowerCasedText to index i, when we have an if condition and the condition is if there is character in frequencies using bracket notation if there is then increase the count of the character when we have an else block if character is not there add one in count then return frequencies

ten we have a variable it is assigned a string after that we assign call of function passing sentence as an argument ten we log that variable and we do same another time
