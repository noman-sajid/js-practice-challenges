ok we have a function getObjectValues and we pass obj as a parameter in the function we have a variable valuesArray and we assignt it calling values method on Object and pass obj as a paramenter and then we return variable and then we have two varible assinge objects with propertis, and we have log statements

basically the important thing to notice here is the value method i would call it close cousin of key method it get the values of properties of the objects
