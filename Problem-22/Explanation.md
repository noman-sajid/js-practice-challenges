we have a function manageCustomerQueue it is an empty function that does not have any parameters. Inside the function, we have a variable customerQueue assigned an empty array and we log the array and we use the unshift method so it adds a new element at index 0 and returns an new array we do it couple of times logging each time then we call its opposite shift method that removes element at index 0 and returns a new array we cal fnction at the end, lets not forget the empty case in the shift it returns an empty array with no errors because there is nothing to remove and its job is done already if we speak in simple terms
