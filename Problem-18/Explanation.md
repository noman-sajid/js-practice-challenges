we have a function listObjectProperties and we pass item as parameter and in the function we have a variable keys we assign it calling keys method on Object passing item as argument then we call forEach on keys in the callback we have a function passing key as a parameter in the function we have a variale value we assign it to a bracket notation and we get key from item then we log the key and valuse then we have a product variable assigned to and object with some properties then user setting variable assigned to an object then we log the first one detials and after that we log the second one details

now important thing here is the key method it returs an array of the the keys as strings, now nwo forEach loop here goes through each key and gets the valuse of that key using dot notation and logs key and the value that is it
