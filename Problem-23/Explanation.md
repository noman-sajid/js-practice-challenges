we have a function findMax, it takes numbers as parameters. Inside the function, we have a variable max declared using the let keyword, assigned numbers on index 0, then we have a for loop we initiate loop then we have condition which posits it will run until the length of numbers is greater then the i and we itterate each time condition is true inside we have an if condition were numers on indes i whatever that is, greater then max max will the the number at that index that is quite easy but i dont think i have articulated it elegantly then we return max and outside we have numers arry we have a variable result dec using const assigned call of function nums passed as argement and the we log the result variable
