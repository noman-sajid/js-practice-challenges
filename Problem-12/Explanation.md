we have a function createSantence and we pass a parameter wordsArray in the function we have a variable sentance and there we chain join method to wordsArray and we pass and empty string as argument, then we return stentance variable 

function ends 

we have a variable and it is assigned an array of strings 

next we create a variable fullSentance and assign it call of createSentance function passing wors as arguement the we log both of them and one of them logs the array other one logs a string 

then we create another variable hyphenatedWords and assign it an array of strings 

then we create joinedWithHyphen variable assigned it calling oin method on hyphnated words and pass a hyphen as argument this willl return an array joined by hyphen then we have a no separators cane we we pass empty inverted comas witout this will return just a string looking like one word 

join does opposite of what split does 

function goes through every element of array so O(2) time complexity
