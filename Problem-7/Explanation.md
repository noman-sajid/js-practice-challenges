We have a function findUserByAge that takes two parameters, users and targetAge, inside that function, we declare a variable foundUser and assign it by calling the find method on users. Inside the find method, there is a callback function that takes user as a parameter and returns list of users with age greater than or equal to targetAge here we use dot notation to access the dot property of user. and then we return the foundUser after that we have a userList variable declared using const keyword and it is an array of objects each objects has two properties name and age then we log the userList and after that we create a variable firstAdult assing it the call of findUserByAge function passing userlest and 18 as arguments and then we log it then we use same login to find firstSenior and finally firstThirtyYearOld important thing ehre is the find method it gives the item that match certain conditon important difference between filter and find how I understand these is that filter gives list of items meeting condition while find gives only one item the first one in the array by index to meet the condition and I guess that is all, and obviously it is O(n) time complexity since it has to go through an array atleast once
