We have a function doubleNumbers it has a prameter numbers inside the function we declare a variable using const keyword and assign it to call of map method on numbers inside that map method wei have anothother function which takes numeber as prameter and returns number times two, basicall what map method does takes a number from numbers multiplies it by two and creates a new array with the new doubled numbers after that function we have a variable declared using const keyword and assigned an array of numbers from 1 to 5, then we have another variable newNumbers const keywords and it is assigned to the call of doubleNumbers function with orignalNumbers variable as an arguement which is an array of numbers then we log both orignalNumbers and newNumbers it will log two arrays

now important thing here is the map method and its function what it does in my understanding is takes an array runs code passed as arguments in it and returns a new array after that
