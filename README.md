JavaScript Practice Challenges
Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to honing my JavaScript understanding through active code analysis and explanation!

This repository serves as a structured journal of JavaScript code snippets and problems that I'm working through. For each challenge, I'll provide my detailed explanation of what the code does, how it works, and the core concepts it demonstrates. This process is designed to deepen my comprehension and improve my ability to read and debug JavaScript effectively.

Repository Structure
Each JavaScript challenge or concept is organized into its own dedicated folder, typically named with a numerical prefix for easy chronological tracking. Inside each challenge folder, you'll find:

problem.md: The original JavaScript code snippet or problem statement.

solution.js: The complete JavaScript code for the problem.

explanation.md: My detailed breakdown and explanation of the code, including:

What the code's overall purpose is.

A step-by-step analysis of how it achieves its goal.

Key JavaScript concepts highlighted.

Any assumptions, edge cases, or personal learning notes.

How to Navigate
Feel free to browse through the numbered folders to see the various challenges and my explanations. Each explanation.md file is where the core learning and reflection takes place.

Current Challenges
01-sum-array: Exploring basic function definition, array iteration with for loops, and sum accumulation.

02-default-parameters: Understanding function parameters, default values, and template literals.

This repository is a live document of my learning journey. I'm excited to see my progress and build a strong foundation in JavaScript!
