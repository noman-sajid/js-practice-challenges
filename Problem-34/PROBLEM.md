Write a function called isEvenOrOdd that takes one number as an argument. The function should return the string "Even" if the number is even and "Odd" if it's odd.


Create a function called findLargestNumber that takes an array of numbers as an argument. The function should find and return the largest number in the array. You should not use any built-in Math functions like Math.max().




Write a function named reverseString that takes a string as an argument and returns the string reversed.



This is a classic coding challenge. Write a function called fizzBuzz that takes one number as an argument. The function should iterate from 1 up to the given number. For each number in the iteration:

If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz".

If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz".

If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

If it's none of the above, print the number itself.





Write a function named countVowels that takes a string as an argument. The function should return the total count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string. The function should be case-insensitive.

Example:
countVowels("hello") should return 2

countVowels("JavaScript") should return 3
