we have a function filterWordsBylength and it takes to parameters, words and minLength. Inside that function, we declare a variable longWords and call the filter method on words in the callback function, which takes word as parameter and it returs the words with length greater than or equal to the max lenght and we close the function and after that we return the longWords and the filterWordsBylenght ends next we declare a variable vocabulary which is an array of words next we have another varaible filteredWords and we assign it the call of filterWordsByLength function and pass two arguments vocabulary and 5 and then we log orignal vocabulary and then we log filtered words with min lenght 5 as we passed the argument in the function

important thing here is how filter method works it runs through an array and returns an array meeting condition we specify in the callback could be vice versa and this problem has a time complexity of O(n)
