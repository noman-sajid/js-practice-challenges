ok first of all we have a function filterEvenNumers and it has a prameter numbersArray inside that number we create a variable using const keword evenNumbers and assign it an empty array after that we have a for loop we initiate the lopp and conditions is run the loop until  i is less then lenght of the numbersArray inside the for loop we have an if statement with conditon which checks if the reminder of number at indexs in the array divided by two is strictly zero using modular operator and if it is it we push number at that index to evenNumbers array this process runs for numbersArray.length times since the for loop here if condition closes and we return the evenNumbers array and function closes then we have a variable declared using const keword and assigned an array of numbers from 1 to 10 next we have another variable declared using the const keword again and this time we assing it the call of filterEvenNumbers passing allNumbers as an argument and finally we log the filtered variable
