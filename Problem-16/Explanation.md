we have a function sort sortNumbersAscending pass numbers as a parameter in the function we call sort method on numbers and pass a callback with two parameters a and b in the callback we return difference of a and b and after that we return the numbers, then we have a variable assigned to an array of numbers after that another variable assigne call of function with the first variable passed as an argument

the we log both of these, nest we have another unsorted array again we call the function and again we log key here is the sort method and how it works can you explain a and b parameters in callback we are passing i get that these are numbers and if we are doing a-b ascending order it will take one number and subtract the other from it if the answer is a positive number than a must be bigger it puts a in the first place in the new sorted array it returns, and this continues until we are done, since we it does not take an initial value it must start from first two elements of array
